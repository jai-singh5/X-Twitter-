This project is a simple clone of the X (formerly Twitter) UI using only **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal is to replicate the main user interface of X while leveraging Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.

## Features

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Basic layout of X, including the navigation bar, tweet feed, sidebar, and trending section.
- Dark mode support (if desired, based on Tailwind configurations).
- Simple hover effects and animations.
- Easily extendable to add more functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure for the clone.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework to design the UI efficiently.
- **PostCSS**: Used for Tailwind CSS compilation (optional, depending on setup).
